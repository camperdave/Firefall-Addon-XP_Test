Currently, this code is really quick and dirty. It's based on an in-game clock example I found on the beta forums. 

This UI Modification adds a text display that shows the player how much XP they have, how much xp they need to reach the next level and how much XP they need to gain.
It was made to make it easier to figure out about how many kills the player needs to level up.

To Install: Copy XP_Text.lua and XP_Text.xml to <Firefall Install Directory>\system\gui\components\MainUI\Addons\XP_Test, making any folders that don't already exist.
Then, just start Firefall and hit escape, hit interface and move the XP_Test icon to wherever you want it on screen
