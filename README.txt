TODO: Add support for when the player levels up!

To Install: Copy XP_Text.lua and XP_Text.xml to <Firefall Install Directory>\system\gui\components\MainUI\Addons\XP_Test, making any folders that don't already exist.
Then, just start Firefall and hit escape, hit interface and move the XP_Test icon to wherever you want it on screen
